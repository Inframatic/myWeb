      <!-- <h2>Building a Responsive Layout and Natural Experience</h2> POTENTIAL TEXT
      <p>Layouts were created using a “mobile-up” methodology, meaning the smallest layout was created first, and then built upon using media queries to change the layout as it grows to larger sizes. By working in this way, devices with lesser processing power (and most likely less Internet bandwidth) are doing the minimal amount of work necessary to display the page — allowing the user to navigate the site quicker. I used the open-source respond.js library to apply a fix for older browsers that don’t support media queries.</p> -->
      <h2>Progressive Enhancement</h2>
      <p class="">With the layout built, I then began progressively enhancing the site to add features to give the site a unique experience.</p>
      <p class="">Elements such as links snap between two colours when hovered over so the user knows the element can be interacted. In supporting browsers, CSS3 transitions are used to smoothly animate between these colours. Lots of small enhancements such as this were implemented, ensuring the experience works for all browsers but is then enhanced in modern browsers that support a wider amount of features.</p>
