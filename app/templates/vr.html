        A top of the line web/flash application that allows users preview our experiences through virtual reality before buying them. This software views 360 degree images and videos by stitching together the media in the inside of a 3D sphere. A virtual camera is placed inside that sphere where the user can control where he is looking inside simply by moving his head.
      </p>
      <p class="project-description2">
        The beta version of this app features a menu inside virtual reality for the user to navigate through different videos and images. The user can opt out of videos, play again, or purchase the event simply by activating the media bar that appears as a 3D object whereever the user is looking in that moment

      <h2>My Role</h2>
      <p>
        Planned, designed and built from the ground up the entire krpano VR web app using JavaScript and XML. The entire application consists of a home page and a lazy loaded list that contains all of the image VR media. 

        The virtual reality menu features a Home Menu displaying different Featured 360 degree experience gifts as well as filters to view all videos or all images. I also developed a way for the user to navigate themselves to the Coupon Redeem page after a video has ended.
      </p>
      <p>
       The entire vr menu is comprised of 3D panels that have been dynamically generated using a simple script I made in the controller.
      </p>
      <p>
        Not wanting users to waste a ton of data when viewing our 360 video (up to 50 mb), I created a way for our application to read the specifics of the users phone like their internet speed, whether they are connected to WiFi or using data, which device they are using with which operating system, whether their phone has gyroscopes or accelerometers.
      </p>

      <p>
        In the early stages of this project, I had recreated all of these features minus the in-VR menu using three.JS instead of krpano
